The BeIT Memcached client was developed by [mailto:skrolle@gmail.com Henrik Schr√∂der] and Oliver Kofoed Pedersen for our company, [http://www.beit.dk BeIT ApS].

We have used the client successfully in a number of consultancy projects, and we are using it extensively in our own latest product, [http://nonoba.com Nonoba], a social gaming website.
